    "a. Draw the block diagram of a system using proportional control, similar to that shown in Figure 2 except that the command and the output are angular positions. Assume that the motor is armature-controlled and that its armature time constant is negligible. Let the inertia $I_e$ be the equivalent inertia of the entire system, as felt on the motor shaft, and let $N_e$ be the equivalent gear ratio of the entire system, as felt on the motor shaft. Show the necessary transfer functions for each block.\n",

    "The analysis is similar to that shown in Figure 10.3.9 in the text, but the inductor is removed from the armature circuit because the time constant is negligible, and the angle of rotation is the output, which means the integrator ($\\frac{1}{s}$) must be added to the block diagram. The resistive torque is ignored.\n",
