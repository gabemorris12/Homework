    "The number of slip systems may be found by multiplying the number of diagonals along the closest packed plane (or highest atomic density plane for BCC) by the number of planes within that family of close packed planes. For the FCC system, the closest packed plane is the {111} family. For the BCC, the highest atomic density plane is the {110} family.\n",

The $(111)$-type planes at opposite faces of the octahedron that are parallel to each other are considered the same type of $(111)$ slip plane. Thus, there are only four different types of $(111)$ slip planes in the FCC crystal structure\" (p. 259). The number of redundant slip systems is a subjective term. If all planes and all directions are considered, then each plane would have 6 diagonals (shown for each plane in Figure 1), and there would be an additional 4 planes from the above octahedral. If this is what is considered redundant, then there would be\n",
