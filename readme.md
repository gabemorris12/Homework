# Purpose

This repo is just here to provide a template for all my homeworks and a place to keep things organized as well as
implement version control on all assignments. To see the different finished homework assignments, select the branch
dropdown menu, which is on branch `master` by default. Some homework assignments may not appear here if I decide to not 
run `git push origin <Homework Branch>`.
